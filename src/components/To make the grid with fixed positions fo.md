To make the grid with fixed positions for empty slots and notes (with changes being permanent), you should store the current positions of the notes in the grid in your API. This way, the positions will persist across sessions and reloads.

### Why store positions in the API?
1. **Persistence**: Storing positions in the API ensures that the grid layout remains consistent even after refreshing the page or accessing the app from a different device.
2. **Flexibility**: You can easily update and retrieve the positions from the backend, allowing for dynamic updates and synchronization across users if needed.
3. **Scalability**: If you decide to add features like collaborative editing, having positions stored in the API makes it easier to manage the state.

### What to do:
1. **Update the API**:
  - Add a `position` field (e.g., `rowIndex` and `colIndex`) to your note model in the backend.
  - When a note is moved, update its position in the API.

2. **Modify the `onDrop` Handler**:
  - After swapping notes or moving a note, send a request to the API to update the positions of the affected notes.

3. **Fetch Positions on Load**:
  - When the app loads, fetch the notes along with their positions from the API and render them in the correct slots.

### Example Changes:
- **Backend**: Add `rowIndex` and `colIndex` fields to your note model.
- **Frontend**:
  Update the `onDrop` handler to send a request to the API:
  ```jsx
  onDrop(sourceNoteId, targetNoteId, targetRowIndex, targetColIndex) {
   // Update positions in the backend
   fetch('/api/notes/update-positions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      sourceNoteId,
      targetNoteId,
      targetRowIndex,
      targetColIndex,
    }),
   }).then(() => {
    // Optionally refetch notes or update state locally
   });
  }
  ```

By storing positions in the API, you ensure that the grid layout is consistent and permanent.
